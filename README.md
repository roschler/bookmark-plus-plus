Open Source Repository for Bookmark++, a Bookmark Management Tool That Utilizes Chrome Local APIs

## Introduction

Bookmark++ is a Chrome V3 extension that leverages Chrome local APIs and cutting-edge AI technologies to help you manage and search your bookmarks effectively. It uses the Summarization API to summarize the content of a web page before storing it in local storage, and the Prompt API to process bookmark searches.  Transformer.js is used with a local copy of the Jina embeddings model to create the embeddings needed for the natural language search features.  This ensures that Bookmark++ operates completely privatelyâ€”your data never leaves your browser.  

Bookmark++ transforms your bookmark collection into a searchable database, allowing you to find relevant web pages using natural language queries. Even better, it supports analytical queries, making your bookmarks an advanced knowledge base rather than just a static collection of web page references.

## Features

- **Local AI Processing**: Ensures privacy by performing all operations directly in your browser.
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Automatically generates summaries of bookmarked pages.
- **Search with Natural Language**: Use simple keywords or complex queries to find bookmarks.
- **Customizable Summaries**: Adjust summary styles to suit your preferences.
- **User Notes**: Add personalized annotations to bookmarks for richer search results.
- **Analytical Queries**: Perform advanced searches to uncover insights from your bookmarks.

## Requirements

- The latest **Canary build of Chrome**, which includes experimental natural language APIs.
- A modern GPU with at least 4GB of VRAM for local AI processing.
