Below is a user query and a document.

Answer the user's query as best as you can using the document text.  You should use the first-person voice in your answer.

Be concise and focused.  Do not include information in the document in your answer that is not somehow related to the user query.

Assume this is a one shot query.  Do not ask the user if they need any more help or if they have any more questions.

Here is the user query:

${userQuery}

Here is the document:
